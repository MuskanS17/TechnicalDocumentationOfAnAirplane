    <h1 style="color:bisque;"> Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM)</h1> 
    <p>
    The most important document for the maintenance of aircraft is the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM). The data contained in the AMM is in general compliant with ATA Specification 2200 (iSpec2200), Information Standards for Aviation Maintenance, and ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English.
    </p> <p>
    The content of the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) is part of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (ICA) that Aircraft Manufacturer, as the Type Certificate Holder, is required to provide and maintain.
    </p> <p>
    The AMM contains the instructions for the on-aircraft maintenance necessary to ensure the continued airworthiness of the aircraft.
    </p> <p>
    The AMM contains information required to service, repair, replace, adjust, inspect and check equipment and systems on the aircraft. These tasks are normally performed on the ramp or in the maintenance hangar.
</p><p>
    The AMM contains the necessary data to cover scheduled maintenance procedures prescribed by the Maintenance Review Board Report (MRBR), respectively the Maintenance Planning Document (MPD) and the deactivation/reactivation procedures relative to Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL) respectively to the Configuration Deviation List (CDL).

    <h1 style="color:bisque;">  Structural Repair Manual (SRM)</h1>   
    <p></p>
The Structural Repair Manual (SRM) has been prepared in accordance with Air Transport Association Specification iSpec 2200, to include descriptive information as well as specific instructions and data relative to the field repair of structures and structural components of the Aircraft.
</p><p>
The Structural Repair Manual (SRM) contains information about the Allowable Damage Limits, material Identification for structure subjects to field Repair, typical Repairs which are generally applicable to structural components of the airplane, that are most likely to be damaged. In addition to that substitute materials and fastener information as well as a brief description of some procedures carried out in conjunction with structural repairs,
 such as protective treatment of repair parts and sealing of integral fuel tanks.</p>

    <h1 style="color:bisque;"> Non-Destructive Testing Manual (NDTM)</h1>   
    <p>
The information in the Non-Destructive Testing Manual is provided for the purpose of instructing qualified personnel with regard to specific nondestructive testing procedures for the aircraft. These procedures are intended to ensure early recognition of structural damage. The recognition of structural damage at an early stage enables steps to be taken which will prevent the damage from becoming critical and thus maintain the structural 
integrity of the aircraft and ensure the continued airworthiness of the aircraft</p>

    <h1 style="color:bisque;">Duct and Fuel Pipe Repair Manual (DFPRM)</h1> 
    <p>
The Duct and Fuel Pipe Repair Manual (DFPRM) gives the operator the necessary data for ducts and fuel pipes which have been damaged in-service. The DFPRM helps in the identification, inspection, and repair of ducts (and where applicable the insulation covers) and fuel pipes. The repair information given is applicable only for ducts and fuel pipes manufactured fully by the Aircraft Manufacturer. The repair information must not be used for ducts or fuel pipes made by the manufacturers of the engine.
</p><p>
The manual is self-contained and cross-references to other sources of information are kept to a minimum. The operator can use this data to:
<ul>
 <li>Find the fuel pipes, ducts and the insulation covers</li>
 <li>Find allowable damage limits for fuel pipes and ducts</li>
    <li>Repair the fuel pipes, ducts and the insulation covers</li>
        <li>Do the tests that are necessary after repair</li></ul> </p>

    The Maintenance Planning Document (MPD) contains repetitive maintenance tasks published in the Maintenance Review Board Report (MRBR), the Airworthiness Limitation Section (ALS) Parts 2, 3, 4, and 5, and the ETOPS CMP documents and provides additional information about maintenance tasks, their scheduling, and procedures.
    ></p><p>
    MPD is used by operators to develop their locally approved scheduled maintenance programs.
    Development of the MPD is part of the Scheduled Maintenance Process, itself identified in the Aircraft Manufacturer DOA (Design Organization Approval) and is audited on a regular basis in the frame of the Aircraft Manufacturer’s Quality Assurance System. As such, the MPD complies with the 
    content of several approved source documents
